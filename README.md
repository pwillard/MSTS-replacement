# MSTS-replacement
These were  originally started as MSTS replacements but started to include more models that could be used to replace items in Open Rails that began life as MSTS items.

These are all in the process of being updated and in a state of flux.

All are free to use and modify as I have supplied the Blender source files for each model.
